## What I Built
Two interactive AI prototypes for training and education:

### 1. AI 3D Asset Generator
- Type something like "hard hat" or "fire extinguisher"
- See a 3D model appear that you can rotate and zoom
- Get an educational summary about the object
- Shows how AI could help create training content

### 2. AI Training Avatar  
- Type commands like "walk to table" or "wave hello"
- Watch a 3D avatar follow your instructions
- Get explanations of what the AI is doing
- Shows how natural language could control training simulations

## How to Run Locally
